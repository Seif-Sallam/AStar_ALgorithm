# AStar_ALgorithm
This project is a demonstration of the A* Algorithm with SFML used as a Graphics Library.

It was made on a 16x16 grid-based graph, however, the algorithm can be used on any shaped graph and with whatever size.

## To compile the code:
```
1- You need to download the Latest version of the SFML library at: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php
2- Put the SFML library in the solution directory (Visual Studio)
3- Put all the source files and the header files in the same directory of main.cpp
```
### Speical Thanks:
This was mainly inspired by the One Lone Coder with the video:
